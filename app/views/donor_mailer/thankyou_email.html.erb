    <h4>
      Dear <%= @computer.donor.donor_name %>,
    </h4>
    
    <p>
      Thank you for your generous donation to The Turing Trust. We have successfully received
      your donation form. Your unique donor ID is #<%= @computer.donor.id %> - please keep this 
      safe as you will require it if you donate again in the future. Your computer's Turing Track
      reference ID is #<%= @computer.turingtrack %> and its associated barcode is displayed below.<br>
      <%= raw @barcode_for_html.to_html %><br>
      
      When shipping your donation, please print this barcode and attach it to your computer. 
      Failing that, we ask that you please write your reference ID directly on your computer
      with an indelible marker.<br><br>
  
      This helps us to trace the journey of your computer over its new life, so we can let you know exactly what impact 
      it has had on the lives of aspiring technologists across rural Ghanaian schools. While your donation might seem 
      like old tech to you, it has the capability to change the lives of its recipients. So thank you once again, for 
      contributing to those in need.<br><br>
     
      The next thing to do is organise your courier, which can be done at the  <a href="http://www.p4d.co.uk/">following website</a>,
      or through any other service provider that you might prefer to use. The address youâ€™ll want to send it to is the following:<br><br>
