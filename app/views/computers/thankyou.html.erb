    <h3>Dear <%= @computer.donor.donor_name %>,</h3>
    
    <h3>
      Thank you for your generous donation to The Turing Trust. We have successfully received
      your donation form. Your unique donor ID is #<%= @computer.donor.id %> - please keep this 
      safe as you will require it if you donate again in the future. 
    </h3>
    
    <h3>
      Your computer's Turing Track reference ID is #<%= @computer.turingtrack %>

      A email will shortly be sent to the address you specified containing both your reference ID 
      and barcode. When shipping your donation, please print this barcode and attach it to your computer. 
      Failing that, we ask that you please write your reference ID directly on your computer with an indelible marker. 
    </h3>

    <h3>
      This helps us to trace the journey of your computer over its new life, so we can let you know exactly what impact 
      it has had on the lives of aspiring technologists across rural Ghanaian schools. While your donation might seem 
      like old tech to you, it has the capability to change the lives of its recipients. So thank you once again, for 
      contributing to those in need.
    </h3>
    
    <h3>
      The next thing to do is organise your courier, which can be done at the <%= link_to "following website", "http://www.p4d.co.uk/" %>,
      or through any other service provider that you might prefer to use. The address you’ll want to send it to is the following:<br><br>
      
      <% @computer.hub.hub_fao.split(",").each do |e| %>
        <%= e %> <br>
      <% end %>
      <% @computer.hub.hub_location.split(",").each do |e| %>
        <%= e %> <br>
      <% end %><br>
      
      By covering the shipping costs you'll ensure that we can use the maximum amount of our funding
      for the projects we and you are supporting.

      Please also remember to share our cause on Facebook and Twitter, across your network of family and friends, 
      and help us extend our reach. With your support we can empower our students.

    <h3>All the best from your team at The Turing Trust</h3>
