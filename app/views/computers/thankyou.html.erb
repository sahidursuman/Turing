      A email will shortly be sent to the address you specified containing both your reference ID 
      and barcode. When shipping your donation, please print this barcode and attach it to your computer. 
      Failing that, we ask that you please write your reference ID directly on your computer with an indelible marker.

      This helps us to trace the journey of your computer over its new life, so we can let you know exactly what impact 
      it has had on the lives of aspiring technologists across rural Ghanaian schools. While your donation might seem 
      like old tech to you, it has the capability to change the lives of its recipients. So thank you once again, for 
      contributing to those in need.
